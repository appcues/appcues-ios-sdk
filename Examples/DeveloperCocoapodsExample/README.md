# Appcues Cocoapods Example App

This is a simple iOS app that integrates with Appcues iOS SDK using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/).

## ðŸš€ Setup

```sh
$ pod install
```

This example app requires you to fill in an Appcues Account ID and an Appcues Application ID before the app will compile. You can enter your own values found in [Appcues Studio](https://studio.appcues.com), or use the following test values:

```
APPCUES_ACCOUNT_ID=103523
APPCUES_APPLICATION_ID=8bc9bdb8-6546-4781-95f8-75abee12fa7a
```

## âœ¨ Functionality

The example app demonstrates the core functionality of the Appcues iOS SDK across 4 screens.

Textfields are included to update the profile attributes for the current user using `Appcues.identify()`.
