    /// If this is the case, we add an empty placeholder implementation and then swizzle that.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - targetInstance: Instance of the class to replace the method in.
    ///   - targetSelector: Selector of the method to replace.
    ///   - replacementOwner: Class containing the methods selected by `swizzleSelector` and `placeholderSelector`.
    ///   - placeholderSelector: Selector of the method to use the `targetSelector` method is not implemented.
    ///   This should be an empty function.
    ///   - swizzleSelector: Selector of the method to use as the replacement.
