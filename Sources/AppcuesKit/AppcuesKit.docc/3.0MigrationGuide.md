# 2.x to 3.0 Migration Guide

## Overview

Updating to this release will not require any code changes for most SDK installations.  Code changes would only be required if your app implemented custom experience traits or actions.

## General Changes

### Removed

- To simplify the public API, `AppcuesExperienceAction` and `AppcuesExperienceTrait` related classes and functions no longer have public visibility. There are no current use cases for extensibility that require these to be public.
